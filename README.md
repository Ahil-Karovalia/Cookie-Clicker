# Cookie-Clicker

A simple and interactive Cookie Clicker game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, players click on a giant cookie to accumulate cookies and can buy various upgrades that automatically generate cookies over time. The game simulates incremental growth and showcases basic game mechanics and UI layout.

# Features
  - Cookie Clicking: Click the large cookie to collect cookies.
